> **For The Better Monash** — Muster is an independent, free project created by a Monash student with a simple goal: to make everyday learning through Moodle more efficient and accessible. Courses, deadlines, announcements and resources all in one place — less time digging through Moodle, more time actually learning. When students study better, Monash gets better, one small step at a time.

Muster is a desktop app for students. It aggregates everything scattered across Moodle — courses, assignments, deadlines, quizzes, announcements and resources — into one clean dashboard, so you never miss a due date again.

## ✨ Highlights

### 📅 Unified Deadline Calendar
Every assignment, quiz and exam deadline from all your courses is merged into one timeline, grouped by **today / next 7 days / this month**. No more digging through each course page to find out what is due.
> For example: one glance tells you — Quiz 1 is due in 3 days, AT3 in 2 weeks.

### 🔔 Smart Reminders
System notifications fire before a deadline, when new materials are synced, when a course posts a new announcement, and when grades are released. You pick how early to be reminded (1 / 3 / 7 days).
> For example: you get a notification "Applied Task AT3 — due in 3 days" while working on something else.

### 📄 Assignment Tracking
Assignments are sorted by due date with the **real submission status** from Moodle (submitted / graded / pending). Past-semester items are automatically archived into a quiet "past courses" section — they never nag you again.
> For example: the progress bar only counts assignments that actually have a submission status, so it is honest.

### 🗂️ Announcement Intelligence
Announcements are auto-classified (assignment / quiz / exam / material / grade), grouped by course, sorted unread-first, with a one-tap type filter. No more scrolling a flat wall of posts.
> For example: filter to "exam" and instantly see every exam-related notice across all courses.

### 📥 Download Manager
Batch-download course materials (PDFs, slides, folders) to a local folder with live progress and speed, and open the folder after download. Study offline, anywhere.
> For example: before a long flight, download this week's lectures in one click.

### 🤖 AI Course Summaries
One click summarizes the week's materials, assignments and announcements — with **streaming output** (text types in live) and full Markdown rendering. The summary language follows your interface language.
> For example: open a course, tap "generate", and get a structured summary: overview → key resources → assignments & quizzes → next steps.

### 🔒 Privacy-First
All data stays on your machine. Authentication goes through Monash Okta SSO directly — no plain-text password is ever stored, and session cookies are protected by the OS credential store.
> For example: uninstall the app and nothing of yours is left on any server.


## 🚀 Getting Started

> **Supported Platforms**: 
> - **macOS (Apple Silicon M1 / M2 / M3 / M4)**: macOS Monterey (12.0) or later.
> - **Windows 10 / 11 (64-bit)**.

1. Download the latest installer for your system from the [Releases](https://github.com/Poetrynan/Muster/releases) page:
   - **macOS**: `Muster_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg` (Apple Silicon M-Series)
   - **Windows**: `Muster_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe`
2. Launch the app and sign in with your Monash account (Okta SSO).
3. Click **Sync with Moodle** — courses, assignments, resources and announcements will be fetched automatically.

> For developers who want to build from source on Mac: run `npm install && npm run build:mac` (Rust toolchain with `aarch64-apple-darwin` target required).

## 🔐 Data & Privacy

- All authentication goes directly through Monash Okta SSO — the app never stores your plain-text Moodle password.
- Session cookies are kept in your OS credential store and never leave your machine.
- Course materials remain the property of their respective owners; this tool only helps you browse and organize them locally.
- Synchronisation is deliberately low-frequency and gently rate-limited (requests are spaced and capped), so Muster always stays well within normal, human-scale usage levels.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Muster is an independent personal productivity tool. It is not a Monash University or Moodle product and is not affiliated with Monash University or Moodle Pty Ltd. It only accesses the courses your own account is already entitled to; you remain responsible for complying with your institution's acceptable-use policy and with the copyright in any material you download.
